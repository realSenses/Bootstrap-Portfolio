#Bootstrap-Portfolio

Bootstrap Portfolio assignment for KU Coding Bootcamp. The portfolio was completely recoded using bootstrap 4, and is designed to both utilize bootstrap elements, and be fully responsive across all devices and viewports. It will be updated as more assignments are completed, and portfolio items are created.

It builds on the <a href="https://github.com/realSenses/Basic-Portfolio">Basic Portfolio</a> and <a href="https://github.com/realSenses/Responsive-Portfolio">Responsive Portfolio</a> assignments I previously made.
